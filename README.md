# Tweepy_MM

Originally done in 2019 for an assignment to create a Mathematical Model tracking how fast news/information spreads.

Used Tweepy API to gather data (favourite and retweets) of a tweet. Once a new tweet was made from chosen news accounts, the favourite and retweet count of the tweet would be recorded every minute.

Xlwt was used to create excel files using the data.
